It is false by default.\n\nif w is a StatsBase.AbstractWeights, the weights are applied to the set 𝐂. If w is a Function, the weights are found passing each matrix in the set to such function. An appropriate choice for AJD algorithms minimizing a least-squares criterion, like OJoB and NoJoB, is the nonDiagonality function (Congedo et al.(2008)🎓). By default, no weights are applied.\n\nIf preWhite is true the solution is found by the two-step procedure described here above in section pre-whitening for AJD. By default, it is false. Dimensionality reduction can be obtained at this stage using arguments eVarC and eVarMeth, in the same way they are used to find the subspace dimension p, but using the accumulated regularized eigenvalues of\n\nfrac1ksum_l=1^kC_k.\n\nThe default values are:\n\neVarC is set to 0.999\neVarMeth=searchsortedfirst.\n\nIf sort is true (default), the vectors in .F are permuted as explained here above in permutation for AJD, otherwise they will be in arbitrary order.\n\nA matrix can be passed with the init argument in order to initialize the matrix F to be found by the AJD algorithm. If nothing is passed (default), following Congedo et al. (2011)🎓 F is initialized with the eigevector matrix of\n\nfrac1ksum_l=1^kC_k^2.\n\ntol is the tolerance for convergence of the solving algorithm. By default it is set to the square root of Base.eps of the nearest real type of the data input. This corresponds to requiring the relative change across two successive iterations of the average squared norm of the column vectors of F to vanish for about half the significant digits. If the solving algorithm encounter difficulties in converging, try setting tol in between 1e-6 and 1e-3.\n\nmaxiter is the maximum number of iterations allowed to the solving algorithm (1000 by default). If this maximum number of iteration is attained, a warning will be printed in the REPL. In this case, try increasing maxiter and/or tol.\n\nIf verbose is true (false by default), the convergence attained at each iteration will be printed in the REPL.\n\neVar and eVarMeth are used to define a subspace dimension p using the accumulated regularized eigenvalues in Eq. [ajd.7].\n\nThe default values are:\n\neVar is set to the dimension of the matrices in 𝐂\neVarMeth=searchsortedfirst.\n\nNote that passing nothing or a real nummber as eVar (see subspace dimension) is meningful only if sort is set to true (default) and if the input matrices C_1C_k are positive definite.\n\nIf simple is set to true, p is set equal to the dimension of the matrices C_1C_k and only the fields .F and .iF are written in the constructed object. This corresponds to the typical output of AJD algorithms.\n\n(2) Approximate joint diagonalization with a set of k data matrices 𝐗 as input; the covariance matrices of the set are estimated using arguments covEst, dims and meanX (see covariance matrix estimations) and passed to method (1) with the remaining arguments of method (2).\n\nSee also: PCA, CSP, mAJD.\n\nExamples:\n\nusing Diagonalizations, LinearAlgebra, PosDefManifold, Test\n\nt, n, k=50, 10, 4\nA=randn(n, n) # mixing matrix in model x=As\nXset = [genDataMatrix(t, n) for i = 1:k]\nXfixed=randn(t, n)./1\nfor i=1:length(Xset) Xset[i]+=Xfixed end\nCset = _crossCov(Xset, 1, k; dims=1)\nCset = ℍVector([ℍ(Cset[l]) for l=1:k])\n# method (1)\naC=ajd(Cset; simple=true)\n# method (2)\naX=ajd(Xset; simple=true)\n@test aX≈aC\n\n# create 20 random commuting matrices;\n# they all have the same eigenvectors\nCset2=randP(3, 20; eigvalsSNR=Inf, commuting=true)\n# estimate the approximate joint diagonalizer (ajd)\na=ajd(Cset2)\n# the ajd must be equivalent to the eigenvector matrix\n# of any of the matrices in Cset2\n@test spForm(a.F'*eigvecs(Cset2[1]))+1.0≈1.0\n\n# normalize the trace of input matrices,\n# give them weights according to the `nonDiagonality` function,\n# apply pre-whitening and limit the explained variance both\n# at the pre-whitening level and at the level of final vector selection\na=ajd(Cset; trace1=true, w=nonD, preWhite=true, eVarC=10, eVar=0.99)\n\na=ajd(Cset; preWhite=true)\n\nusing Plots\n# plot the original covariance matrices\n# and their transformed counterpart\nCMax=maximum(maximum(abs.(C)) for C ∈ Cset);\n h1 = heatmap(Cset[1], clim=(-CMax, CMax), title=\"C1\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n h2 = heatmap(Cset[2], clim=(-CMax, CMax), title=\"C2\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n h3 = heatmap(Cset[3], clim=(-CMax, CMax), title=\"C3\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n h4 = heatmap(Cset[4], clim=(-CMax, CMax), title=\"C4\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n 📈=plot(h1, h2, h3, h4, size=(700,300))\n\nDset=[a.F'*C*a.F for C ∈ Cset];\n DMax=maximum(maximum(abs.(D)) for D ∈ Dset);\n h5 = heatmap(Dset[1], clim=(-DMax, DMax), title=\"F'*C1*F\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n h6 = heatmap(Dset[2], clim=(-DMax, DMax), title=\"F'*C2*F\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n h7 = heatmap(Dset[3], clim=(-DMax, DMax), title=\"F'*C3*F\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n h8 = heatmap(Dset[4], clim=(-DMax, DMax), title=\"F'*C4*F\", yflip=true, c=:bluesreds);\n 📉=plot(h5, h6, h7, h8, size=(700,300))\n\n\n(Image: Figure AJD1)\n\n(Image: Figure AJD2)\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"function"},{"location":"pca/#PCA-1","page":"PCA","title":"PCA","text":"","category":"section"},{"location":"pca/#","page":"PCA","title":"PCA","text":"Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is obtained by eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition.
